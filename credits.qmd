### Partners

- Alaska Center for Energy and Power ([ACEP](https://www.uaf.edu/acep/)) at the University of Alaska Fairbanks ([UAF](https://www.uaf.edu/uaf/index.php))
- Institute of Social and Economic Research ([ISER](https://iseralaska.org)) at the University of Alaska Anchorage ([UAA](https://www.uaa.alaska.edu))

Data used in the energy workbooks comes from a variety of sources and partners, but special thanks to the Alaska Energy Authority for partnering with the team to make the base line power cost equalization datasets available. Without this openness, this report would not be possible. We would also like to thank the utilities who responded directly when we had questions. A full list of these organizations has been complied in @sec-sources.
